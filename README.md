# I'm Making A Browser

One day I installed Microsoft Edge. That's the same thing as Chrome, but with a different frame. So I decided to make my own browser... with a different frame.

## Dev Tasks

### Improvements

-   **Flex Hub**
    -   **Titlebars** – A better (and more consistent) titlebar design
    -   **Preferences** – Implement the new titlebar and stack contents more vertically
    -   **Back Button** – Add back button to each page of the Flex Hub (other than the main hub)

### New Features

-   **Bookmarks**
    -   **Bookmark Button** – The ability to add new bookmarks
    -   **Bookmarks Page** – The ability to view bookmarks
-   **First Start Initialization**
    -   **Features Display** – Should give a quick walkthrough of all features.
